# Description

This script is designed for password cracking purposes to gain access to a specific 
user account on the system. The user must specify the username for which the passwords 
need to be cracked as well as the path to the file containing the list of possible passwords.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The script executes a loop that reads each password from the list and attempts 
to authenticate on the system as the specified user. If the correct password is 
found, the script outputs a success message and exits. Otherwise, the script outputs a failure message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to get root access, use "root_enumPASS" file

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before using the script, you need to change the `user` and `file` variables.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, it is worth noting that using scripts for authentication and security purposes can be 
illegal and risky. This script is created solely for educational purposes and should not be used 
for unauthorized access to the system.
